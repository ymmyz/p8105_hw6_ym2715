``` r
homi_raw = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")

homi = homi_raw 
homi$city_state = paste(homi$city, homi$state, sep = ", ")
homi = homi %>% 
  select(-city, -state) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX",
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ",
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO",
         city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = case_when(victim_race == "White" ~ "white",
                                 TRUE ~ "non-white"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
